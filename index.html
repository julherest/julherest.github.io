      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in the physical and transitional risks that businesses and governments face related to climate change, climate policy, and energy policy. To quantify these climate risks, I develop statistical and machine learning models using data from sources such as satellite imagery and climate models. Currently, I am a Vice President in the Sustainability Research and Modeling team at BlackRock. In the past, I have worked at Descartes Labs as an Applied Scientist, at Stanford University's Department of Earth System Science as a Postdoctoral Scholar, and at The World Bank's Disaster Risk Management and Urban Development Unit as a Short-term Consultant. </p>
